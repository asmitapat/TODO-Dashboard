## Environment Variables

Before deploying the frontend, set the following environment variable in your Vercel (or other) dashboard:

- `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`: The full URL of your deployed backend (e.g., Render URL)
  - Example: `https://your-backend.onrender.com`

**Do not commit secrets to source control.**

Set this in your Vercel dashboard under Project Settings > Environment Variables.
